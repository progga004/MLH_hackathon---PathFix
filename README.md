### Inspiration

The students always find it difficult to correlate their existing skillsets/skillsets they want to achieve at school at the early stage of their life with the skillsets needed to work in a corporate world. We also find that there are a lot of hoaxes that are being spread like - "Droppers are the best achievers". We strongly believe that if a student can carve their college course path clearly, knowing what they can achieve in the future, they can excel in a better manner.

### What it does

Acts as a bridge between course skillsets and job skillsets

### How we built it

Django, HTML, JS, NLTK, Bootstrap, and Git.

Check this presentation out for some insights on the pipeline. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qlguzRghQns0pc0C5V2vqEBxeD7iNQ0BGpF55h5VIbI/edit?usp=sharing

### What's Next:

Currently, we have the functionality to get tech/non-tech skillsets gained from the combination courses studied at SBU CSE and the prospective jobs one can achieve using the skillsets achieved from the courses. In the future, a proper scalable provision is provided to add:

Courses to take at SBU to get better probability to achieve the given jobs.
External Courses (online) to do in order to enhance the chances to land in a dream job.
